# 👋 Hey, I'm Jord (aka stillbuilds)

Tinkerer turned aspiring indie hacker — building my way out of the factory, one project at a time.

## 🔨 What I’m Working On

- 🧱 **FuseCore** – Modular CMS & dashboard system powering [stillbuilds.com](https://stillbuilds.com) (launching soon)
- **More Details Coming Soon**

## 📚 Goals

- Build real tools that are beautiful, useful, and non-exploitative
- Replace my factory income with indie revenue or remote work by **Oct 10, 2025**
- Share the journey publicly with transparency, intent, and maybe some jokes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Fedora / Hyprland
- Neovim (NvChad)
- Next.js / TypeScript / Prisma / PostgreSQL
- Claude + Open Source LLMs
- Self-hosted (pretty much) everything
